// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const AcademicAssistantApp());

    // We can't verify 'Supabase connected ✅' anymore because the app routes to SignInScreen now.
    // Instead we can just verify the app widget boots successfully.
